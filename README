LSD
===

Java editor for Delwink SSF files.

Build
-----

This program depends on Delwink's jssf library. A compiled jar for it should be
present in the `lib` folder before building manually.

The NetBeans IDE is used in developing this program, which generates `ant`
build scripts by default. You can either load the project in NetBeans yourself,
or you can build with `ant` like so:

    $ ant clean jar

The environment variable `JAVA_HOME` needs to point to a valid JDK for the
command-line build to work.

Hacking
-------

LSD uses the [Sun coding style][1] for Java with a soft limit of 79 columns in
the source code.
